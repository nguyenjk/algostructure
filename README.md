# algostructure
learning new language through algorithm and data structure inspiring from this 

## why algorithm and datastructure in different language. 
Starting in July 2020, I wanted to learn python and go for my job at godaddy. I want to be able to practice the syntax and other technique from the language I learn. I thought what is the best way to learn new language ? I can learn through algorithm and data structure and by doing these problems, I can review my coding skills and at the same time learn problem solving with new language that I need to pick up. Therefore, this is where I am keeping. 

Most of the problem here I collected from [William Fiset](https://github.com/williamfiset/Algorithms). I might collect more from different sources as time go.
